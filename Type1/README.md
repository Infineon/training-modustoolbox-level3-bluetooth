# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level3 Bluetooth® Type1

This is a class to teach how to use Bluetooth® Low Energy in ModusToolbox™ applications. The descriptions and exercises use a PSoC™ 6 MCU as a host to a 43012 device but they apply to any Bluetooth® application in which the MCU supports the mtb-hal-cat* hardware abstraction library.

A partial list of development kits that are covered by the material in this class is:

- CY8CKIT-062S2-43012
- CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT
- CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W
- CY8CKIT-064S0S2-4343W
- CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
- CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W
- CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2
- CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-43439M2
- CYW9P62S1-43012EVB-01
- CYW9P62S1-43438EVB-01

*Note: some exercises may not work as-is on all kits listed above.*

After completing this class, you should be able to create and debug full Bluetooth® applications using the ModusToolbox™ ecosystem including peripherals, centrals, and beacons.
