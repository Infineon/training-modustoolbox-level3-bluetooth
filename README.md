# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level3 Bluetooth® Type1 and Type2

This is a pair of classes to teach how to use Bluetooth® Low Energy in ModusToolbox™ applications. The Type1 class applies to MCUs that support the mtb-hal-cat* hardware abstraction library (such as PSoC™ 6 + CYW43012). The Type2 class applies to MCUs that support the AIROC™ Bluetooth® SDK (such as CYW20820). While the interaction with the MCU is different, the basic Bluetooth® operation is the same in both classes, so you can choose whichever one best suits your needs.

After completing either of these classes, you should be able to create and debug full Bluetooth® applications using the ModusToolbox™ ecosystem including peripherals, centrals, and beacons.

*Note: The Type2 class also includes 2 chapters on Bluetooth® classic covering the protocol and the wireless serial port profile (SPP).*

For details on the Type1 and Type2 class pre-requisites, organization, chapters, and hardware, see the README.md file in the respective class directory.

**Note: The Type2 class has not been released yet.**
