# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level3 Bluetooth® Type1 and Type2

This is a pair of classes to teach how to use Bluetooth® Low Energy in ModusToolbox™ applications.

The Type1 class applies to AIROC™ Bluetooth® devices paired with an external host (such as CYW43012 + PSoC™ 6) and AIROC™ Bluetooth® devices with two MCUs (such as PSoC™ 63 and CYW20829).

The Type2 class applies to AIROC™ Bluetooth® devices with a single MCU (such as CYW20835). While the interaction with the MCU is different, the basic Bluetooth® operation is the same in both classes, so you can choose whichever one best suits your needs.

After completing either of these classes, you should be able to create and debug full Bluetooth® applications using the ModusToolbox™ ecosystem including peripherals, centrals, and beacons.

For details on the Type1 and Type2 class pre-requisites, organization, chapters, and hardware, see the README.md file in the respective class directory.
