# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level3 Bluetooth®

This is a class to teach how to use Bluetooth® Low Energy in ModusToolbox™ applications. The descriptions and exercises use a PSoC™ 6 MCU as a host to a 43012 device.

After completing this class, you should be able to create and debug full Bluetooth® applications using the ModusToolbox™ ecosystem including peripherals, centrals, and beacons.

This class does **not** cover Bluetooth SOC applications using PSoC 63 BLE devices.
