# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level3 Bluetooth® Type2

This is a class to teach how to use Bluetooth® Low Energy in ModusToolbox™ applications. The descriptions and exercises use a CYW20835 device but they apply to any Bluetooth® application in which the MCU supports the AIROC™ Bluetooth® SDK.

A partial list of development kits that are covered by the material in this class is:

- CYW920835M2EVB-01
- CYW920820M2EVB-01
- CYW920721M2EVB-03
- CYBLE-333074-EVAL-M2B
- CYBT-213043-EVAL
- CYW920706WCDEVAL
- CYW920719B2Q40EVB-01
- CYW920721B2EVK-02
- CYW920819EVB-02
- CYW943012BTEVK-01

*Note: some exercises may not work as-is on all kits listed above.*

After completing this class, you should be able to create and debug full Bluetooth® applications using the ModusToolbox™ ecosystem including peripherals, centrals, and beacons.
